### **Terraform with AWS**

---

## **1. Introduction to Terraform**

### **Why Do We Need Terraform?**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Traditional infrastructure management is manual and error-prone. Terraform allows you to define infrastructure (like EC2, RDS, etc.) using code. This makes it easy to:
  - Reproduce environments.
  - Automate provisioning and scaling.
  - Version control the infrastructure.
  
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), allowing for a single tool to manage infrastructure across different platforms.

- **Declarative Syntax**: You write what the desired infrastructure should look like, and Terraform ensures the environment matches the code.

## **2. Setting Up Terraform**

### **Installation**:
1. Download and install Terraform from the official website [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Add Terraform to your system’s path and verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   terraform --version
   ```

---

## **3. Using AWS with Terraform**

### **Step 1: Configuring AWS Provider**

The **provider** is a plugin in Terraform that allows interaction with APIs (AWS in this case). You will need to configure the AWS provider to define the region and authentication.

- **IAM User Setup**: To interact with AWS, create an **IAM User** in the AWS Console with programmatic access and attach the required permissions (e.g., EC2 Full Access).

1. **Install AWS CLI** and configure it by running:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Enter your IAM user’s **Access Key** and **Secret Key**, along with the default region.

2. **Setting Up the Provider in Terraform**:
   Create a new file `main.tf` for your configuration.
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region     = "us-west-2"
     access_key = "your_access_key"
     secret_key = "your_secret_key"
   }
   ```
   - `region`: Defines the region where your AWS resources will be created.
   - `access_key` and `secret_key`: Authenticate Terraform with AWS.

### **Step 2: Why IAM User is Needed?**
- The **IAM User** is required to allow Terraform access to create and manage AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, etc.). The permissions you assign to this IAM user define what actions Terraform can perform on AWS.

## **4. Creating Your First EC2 Instance Using Terraform**

### **Step 1: Defining the EC2 Instance Resource**
In the same `main.tf` file, you can define an **EC2 instance** resource like this:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"   # Amazon Machine Image ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"                # Instance type (free tier eligible)

  tags = {
    Name = "MyFirstInstance"                # Add a tag to identify the instance
  }
}
```
- `ami`: The AMI ID is the operating system image for your EC2. You can search for available AMIs based on your requirements (Linux, Windows, etc.).
- `instance_type`: This specifies the instance's computing power (t2.micro is often free-tier eligible).

### **Step 2: Initializing Terraform**
Once your configuration is ready, initialize the working directory that contains the configuration:
```bash
terraform init
```
This command downloads the necessary plugins (like AWS) to interact with the cloud.

### **Step 3: Applying the Configuration**
To see what resources will be created, run:
```bash
terraform plan
```
Then to actually create the instance, run:
```bash
terraform apply
```
You will be prompted to confirm the changes; type `yes`.

### **How It Works**:
- **terraform plan** compares your configuration with the real infrastructure and shows what will be added/changed.
- **terraform apply** creates the actual resources in AWS.

## **5. Creating a VPC, Subnet, and Security Group**

### **Step 1: Define a VPC**
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network to launch your AWS resources.
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"    # Define the CIDR block for the VPC
}
```

### **Step 2: Define Subnets**
Subnets divide your VPC into smaller networks.
```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "my_subnet" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
}
```

### **Step 3: Define Security Groups**
Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances.
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "my_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22                    # Allow SSH access
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0                     # Allow all outbound traffic
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Launch EC2 in VPC**
Now you can launch an EC2 instance inside the defined VPC and Subnet.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "my_vpc_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id   # Launch EC2 in your custom subnet
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.my_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "VPCInstance"
  }
}
```

---

## **6. Auto Scaling and Load Balancers**

### **Step 1: Launch Template**
To scale EC2 instances, first create a launch template.
```hcl
resource "aws_launch_template" "app_launch_template" {
  name_prefix   = "app-launch-template"
  image_id      = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### **Step 2: Auto Scaling Group**
Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to automatically scale your instances.
```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "app_asg" {
  launch_template {
    id      = aws_launch_template.app_launch_template.id
    version = "$Latest"
  }

  max_size = 3
  min_size = 1
  desired_capacity = 2
  vpc_zone_identifier = [aws_subnet.my_subnet.id]
}
```

### **Step 3: Load Balancer**
Add a Load Balancer to distribute traffic across the instances.
```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "app_lb" {
  name               = "app-lb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.my_subnet.id]
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "app_tg" {
  name     = "app-tg"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
}
```

## **7. Managing State**

- **Why State is Important**: Terraform maintains a state file (`terraform.tfstate`) to track the resources it manages. This helps Terraform know what resources exist and need to be modified, added, or deleted.

- **Remote State**: For production environments, it’s recommended to store the state file in a remote backend like S3.
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "s3" {
      bucket = "my-terraform-state"
      key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
      region = "us-west-2"
    }
  }
  ```

## **8. Modules in Terraform**

### **Why Use Modules?**
Modules help you **reuse** infrastructure components. For example, if you need to create the same VPC setup for different environments (e.g., dev, prod), a module lets you encapsulate this logic.

### **Creating a Module**
1. Create a `modules/vpc` folder with VPC-related resources.
2. Call this module from your main configuration:
   ```hcl
   module "vpc" {
     source = "./modules/vpc"
     cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
   }
   ```

### **Advantages of Modules**:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Write reusable code.
- Better organization and modularity.

## **9. Conclusion**

- **Start Simple**: Begin by creating basic resources like EC2 instances and VPCs.
- **Scale Up**: Gradually introduce more advanced features like Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, and Modules.
- **State and Version Control**: Manage state carefully and use modules to improve infrastructure management.

By following these steps, you'll gain a strong foundation in using Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure from scratch to advanced levels.
